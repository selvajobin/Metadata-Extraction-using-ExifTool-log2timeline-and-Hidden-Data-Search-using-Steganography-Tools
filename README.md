# Metadata-Extraction-using-ExifTool-log2timeline-and-Hidden-Data-Search-using-Steganography-Tools
## AIM:
To extract metadata, perform timeline analysis, and search for hidden data using forensic tools like ExifTool, log2timeline, and steganography detection tools.

## DESIGN STEPS:
### Step 1:
Use exiftool to extract metadata from files such as images, documents, and videos.

### Step 2:
Use log2timeline and plaso to create and analyze event timelines from system logs and file metadata.

### Step 3:
Apply steganography detection tools like steghide, zsteg, or binwalk to uncover hidden data in media files.

## PROGRAM:
Metadata and Timeline Forensics, Steganography Analysis Steps

## OUTPUT:
# A. Using ExifTool – for file metadata

 Install:
```
sudo apt update
sudo apt install exiftool -y
```
 Extract metadata from a file:
```
exiftool image.jpg
```
 Batch process a folder:
```
exiftool -r /path/to/folder
```
Useful flags:

-G: Show metadata group

-time:all: Show only timestamps

-GPSLatitude -GPSLongitude: Extract GPS data
